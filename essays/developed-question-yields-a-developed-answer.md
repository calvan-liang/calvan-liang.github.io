Stack Overflow is an amazing forum where software engineers can ask questions about code, programming concepts, and programming-related topics. However, if the question does not sufficiently explain the problem, then the answer given will not always sufficiently solve the problem. An answer may not be given at all if the question is too vague. To ensure a question will recieve a proper solution, the question must be smart, detailed, and clear.

According to Eric Raymond's guide on how to ask questions the smart way, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/223918/iterating-through-a-collection-avoiding-concurrentmodificationexception-when-re">this</a> question from Stack Overflow bears some charactersitcs of a "smart" question.

A "stupid" question usually contains a vague subject header, insufficient or unspecific details about the problem, messy formatting, and an unclear end goal. A "stupid" question can also be a question that is already answered elsewhere. If the solution can be easily found with a little research, the same question does not need to be asked again. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45333586/i-need-help-on-ado-net">This</a> question from Stack Overflow bear some characterisitcs of a "stupid" question. "I need help on ADO.net" is a vague subject header and provides very little description about the problem. The user post two pieces of code and asks which one is appropriate. He does not expand upon what he meant by appropriate nor does he clarify what he is trying to achieve in his code. A user who wants to answer his question must read through all the code to develop their own understanding of it. As a result, he received a response stating that there is no difference between the two codes in terms of functionality. The user answering his question cannot choose which code is the appropriate one because the user asking the question did not clarify or expand on what he considers to be appropriate.

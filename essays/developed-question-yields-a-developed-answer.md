Stack Overflow is an amazing forum where software engineers can ask questions about code, programming concepts, and programming-related topics. However, if the question does not sufficiently explain the problem, then the answer given will not always sufficiently solve the problem. An answer may not be given at all if the question is too vague. To ensure a question will recieve a proper solution, the question must be smart, detailed, and clear.

(Paragraph on a smart question)

A "stupid" question usually contains a vague subject header, insufficient or unspecific details about the problem, messy formatting, and an unclear end goal. A "stupid" question can also be a question that is already answered elsewhere. If the solution can be easily found with a little research, the same question does not need to be asked again. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45333586/i-need-help-on-ado-net">This</a> question from Stack OverFlow bear some characterisitcs of a "stupid" question.

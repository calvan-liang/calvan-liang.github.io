# Weaving the Pattern

The phrase "design pattern" applies to various things in the world. You could be stepping on a design pattern right now! Carpets are a prime example of design patterns that are widely seen within the world. They are usually woven with some sort of design. When it comes to weaving carpets, quilts, or blankets, it is important to follow a certain technique or work pattern to achieve the desired results. Does a carpet necessarily need a pretty pattern to function as it is intended to? The short answer is no. Assuming both carpets are made with the same material, an ugly carpet will function just as well as a pretty carpet. The ugly pattern may be haphazardly put together but in the end, both carpets are practically identical in functionality. However, if a consumer had to choose between a beautiful floral carpet and a carpet that looks like a dog took a leak on it, he or she will most definitely choose the floral carpet. Yes, both carpets function just fine. The difference is that one will be chosen over the other. 

Just like carpets, there are design patterns in code. It could be your formatting, method of coding, or even how you name your files. your coworkers would appreciate it if your code have a beautiful design pattern.

If you use a class your coworker made and you know he or she does a good job at following design patterns, you can guess what a method is called.

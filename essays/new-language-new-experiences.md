The first programming language I learned is C++. My high school introductory programming course allowed me to find my interest in coding. I immediately decided I wanted to major in Computer Science. When I entered University of Hawaii at Manoa, I panicked when I realized we will be coding in Java, not C++. I was really attached to C++ since it was the only language I knew then. Eventually, I got more comfortable with Java. After taking ICS 111 and ICS 211, it is now my new favorite language. Now in ICS 314, Javascript is introduced to me. Since the word "Java" is in Javascript, I assumed it will be the same as Java, with some minor syntax differences. I was delightfully surprised after programming with Javascript for the first time. 

After only two weeks of working with Javascript, I can see the amazing benefits of this language. Creation of variables is much different from languages such as Java and C++. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that I can create a variable without specifying the data type. This creates a kind of flexibility coding that I would have never imagined. I can declare a variable that will be returned without worrying about the data type. I can return an integer or string using the same variable. I was also amazed that I can put both integers and strings in the same array. I am astounded by the flexibility of Javascript. However, I do not think Javascript would be the best language for someone new to the world of programming. It is important to understand different data types first. From my experience, C++ and Java do that well. Javascript should come after learning either of those languages. That is exactly where I am at. Thus, learning Javascript in ICS 314 after Java in ICS 111 and ICS 211 is a good path that University of Hawaii at Manoa has set for their ICS students. 

“Athletic Software Engineering” is a style of teaching that I find very useful when it comes to programming. A problem ICS students, including me, always initially run into is their unfamiliarity with the language. They may be able to understand code being presented to them, but they lack practice in coding. They complete assignments by referring to class notes and older assignments, rather formulating their own code using what they memorized and practiced with. To break from the mentality of relying on older assignments or notes to complete and assignment, practicing for WODS allows each student to truly familiarize and understand the code they are typing. If a student is given a WOD, he or she should not need to refer to anything. The student should be able to type away, not slowly flipping through some resources they should already know. As a result, better programming practices is reinforced and students must learn how to code efficiently. The practice Workout of the Day (WOD) given to students to prepare for the graded WOD does just that. The WODs require students to extensively practice their coding in order to perform well in class. This type of learning may be stressful, but it is useful since it is a great way to enforce a better understanding of the code being written.

I look forward to coding more with Javascript. I do find the WODs stressful, though it will only motivate me to practice more and improve my coding skills. After all, this will make me a lean, mean, coding machine.

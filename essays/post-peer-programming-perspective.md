# Reduced Physical Contact, Increased Virtual Contact

The current world events severely reduces the amount of physical contact people have with each other. If physical contact is prohibited or reduced, the alternative of virtual contact is brought forth (more). Although it has been long used before the current world events, it proves to be indespensible in a time where physical contact is reduced. Working on the same task with a peer, we primarily utilized Zoom to communicate and concurrently work with each other. I have a desktop and a laptop. This enabled me to view the screenshare of my partner's monitor on my desktop while simulataneously working on my own tasks on my laptop.

# The Virtual Peer Work Experience

On the first day of working real-time in pairs, the most notable advantage is the ability to bring people who are behind up to speed quickly. My partner was dealing with a move that took a couple of days, inhibiting him from making much progress on the assigned task. 

# Floobits Issue

Floobits is a cross-editor that allows real-time collaboration. Unfortunately, we were unable to test out Floorbits. During installation of this plugin for the IntelliJ IDEA IDE, I ran an issue that prevented me from using it. I received a notice that the server's certificate is not trusted. As of right now, I could not find a way to resolve or bypass this issue. However, this does not discourage me from trying other cross-editors in the future. I do not doubt that a cross-editor would be essential to accelerating and streamlining the peer programming process.

The purpose of the Musicians of Manoa application is to allow musicians in Manoa to meet other musicans and hold jam sessions. A user can sign up and log into their profile. After logging in, the user can edit their profile to express their musical capabilities, musical taste, contact information, etc. There is a page where the user can browse other musicians, which enables the user to find other musicans to perform or socialize with. To narrow down the user's search for people of same interest or taste, there are dropdowns where the user can select an intrument or genre of music. Additionally, while browsing through the profiles, the user can give each Musician a rating if they choose to do so. The Jam Sessions page displays events where people can attend to jam out with other musicians. All in all, this application intends to be simple and straighforward way for musicans to meet other musicians in Manoa.

This was a group project. My group of consisted of 6 people (including me). My group members are Leighton Villanuvea, Aljay Fagaragan, Mia Clause, Ty Uehara, and David Badke. My contributions to this project include creating the skeleton of the profile page, creating the footer, connecting links to the correct pages, and managing the github hompage. Since I had the biggest group in class, the biggest challenge when creating this application is coordination between group members. Whenever group members commit their work and merge to the master branch, there is a tendency for conflicting code and unexpected errors. Some people had "old" code, which is already updated by another group member. When they merge the code, the "old" code overlaps with whatever is currently in the master branch, causing chaos and confusion. By the time we reached milestone 3, we learned how to coordinate our merges and modify code accordingly to avoid problems.

The experience I received from this project is a huge transition point for me because it is my first time working as a group through a Github organization. As expected for the first time, there were problems with merging and incompatiable code. This exposed me to the strong coordination needed to work together as a group and combine our code via Github. I also became more familiar with React, which is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. This project increased my confidence in working as a group via Github since I have a better understanding on how to coordinate with team members when merging our code on Github.

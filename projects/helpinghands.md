## Quick Introduction

Helping Hands is a Hawaii State Resource Directory App that was developed by a five member team called HACCsgiving for the 2020 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC). It is intended to help users who need assistance in things such as housing, food, and medical. Users can quickly go on the app and find what exactly what they need in mere seconds, rather than going through a painstaking hunt through various directories on the internet. 

## The 2020 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC)

The 2020 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC) is a competition where participants use their knowledge, skills, and creativity to design an useful application that would benefit the people of Hawaii in some way. Several challenge prompts were presented to the participants to choose from. In teams, participants design and implement their application over roughly three to four weeks. After the first week or so, each team will present what they have implemeted so far to a panel of tehcnical judges and earn points. If the team receives enough points, they will be selected to present their final product in the final presentation. In the final presentation, the applications will be judged by another panel of judges for final scoring. However, unlike the previous years where such presentations would occur in-person, the 2020 HACC was completely virtual. This was due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To keep everyone safe, everyone can stay distanced at home and attend the virtual HACC on a video conferencing platform called **[Zoom](https://zoom.us)**. More information about HACC can be found **[here](https://hacc.hawaii.gov/)**.

## HACCsgiving

My HACC team is comprised of five people. They are **[Kegan Flagg](https://github.com/LukewarmCoffee), [Christopher Na](https://github.com/chrisjna) [Graham Francisco](https://github.com/gbfrancisco), [Micah Kim](https://github.com/kimmicah)** and myself, **[Calvan Liang](https://github.com/calvan-liang)**. We chose the pun of a name "HACCsgiving" because the final presentation takes place a few days before Thanksgiving and the "giving" part somewhat relates to the challenge we chose to develop an app for. Here is the project's **[Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/helping-hands-o96srp)** and **[GitHub](https://github.com/HACC2020/HACCsgiving)**

## The Hawaii State Resource Directory Challenge

The challenge that my team and I chose is in need of an index that lists various available assistive resources in Hawaii. Resources include things such as health insurance, housing assitance programs, and food assistance programs. This resource index can be accessed through an app, where users can quickly find whatever assistance they require. This challenge is given by First Lady Dawn Amano-Ige.

summary: This project is a quick and simple event planner for calendar applications such as Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook. This project was more focused upon the process of working as a team rather than the event planner application itself. The team working process is vital, especially due to the limited physical meetings due to the quarantine caused by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

This project is a quick and simple event planner for calendar applications such as Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook. This project was more focused upon the process of working as a team rather than the event planner application itself. The team working process is vital, especially due to the limited physical meetings due to the quarantine caused by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The name of my team is Team Capers.

For this event planner project, Team Capers employed a certain development process. The focus was on progressing the project milestone by milestone, all while resolving issues that come up along the way. In other words, we adapted and implemented the issue driven project management approach. Although we cannot meet physically, we managed to meet virtually at a minimum of twice a week. Our meeting frequency also depended on the requirement of the current milestone and what issues were needed to be resolved. Communication is done through a messaging platform called Slack. Using Slack, meetings and discussions were easily conducted at our own convenience. If necessary, we used another messaging and video platform called Discord to conduct meetings over video.

Work for each milestone was broken down into sections or issues that can be completed in around 72 hours. We will brainstorm our intended features ahead of time so we can clearly visualize what we need to implement or accomplish to reach our final goal. Each of those features will be packaged down as an “issue.” This method will allow us to focus on certain specific tasks at a single time. These tasks will be gradually completed as we strive towards the final product. Using a platform called GitHub, we have the capability of updating, pushing, and merging our progress into a single shared online repository. This approach has proven to be quite effective in our website development project in ICS-314. It provides everyone with a clear understanding of what needs to be done and will keep everyone updated on the progress or status of each individual task. Each issue on GitHub will be assigned to an “owner.” Difficulty and intensity of each task varies. Tasks that are higher in intensity and difficulty may be given more than 72 hours to complete. Team members who are assigned to such tasks may only be given 1 or 2 tasks for that week to offset the potential workload, as more intense and difficult tasks are usually more time consuming. The decision on how the issues will be split will be discussed and determined by the team. To minimize conflicting merges or problems caused by merging “incompatible” code, each team member will do individual work in their own branch before merging to the master branch. Before officially merging two different branches together, another branch can be made to test the compatibility of those two branches. This ensures that we will have working code before integrating it into our final product. It is already predetermined that our meetings with the TA will be every other week. It is logical, sensible, and pragmatic to set our milestone due dates as the same dates as our face-to-face TA meetings. Our milestones will encompass all of the issues that were assigned throughout a time period of two week. Milestones should yield some sort of application that is functionable and presentable to the TA. To put it simply, there should be some sort of progression in functionality at every milestone. GitHub already provides us with useful tools that will aid us in meeting these milestones. To organize our tasks within a milestone, we will utilize the “backlog”, “in progress” and “done” features to visually see the progress of each milestone. Thus, the Issue Driven Project Management approach is what we will adapt and implement to achieve our intended final goal of a functioning JavaScript calendar event planner.
